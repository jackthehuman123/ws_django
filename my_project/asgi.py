# reads the settings module at import time. If DJANGO_SETTINGS_MODULE is not set
# before importing django.setup(), Django won't know which settings file to use
# and will raise an ImproperlyConfigured error. django.setup() must then be called
# before importing any Django models or apps (like chat.routing) because it
# initializes the app registry — without it, model classes can't resolve their
# app_label and will raise AppRegistryNotReady.
